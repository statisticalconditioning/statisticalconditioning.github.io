# About Statistical Conditioning 

Welcome! The purpose of this site it to serve as a repository for exercises useful for mastering the basics of common statistical methods. Learning statistics is a lot like getting into shape. You wouldn't expect to get into shape simply by going to the gym and listening to your personal trainer talk about the types of exercises you can do; you have to use that knowledge, which means you have repeatedly do the exercises. Expecting to learning statistics through lecture is very similar to getting fit by listening to your personal trainer talk about fitness. While listening can be helpful, it is just the beginning. You have to apply what you learn to become proficient at using the statistical methods.

This site is aimed at supplementing -- but not replacing -- formal statistical training. Returning to the fitness analogy, you could walk into a gym and use the equipment with no understanding of the correct technique. At best this could be inefficient; at worst, it could lead to injury. Likewise, to best use this site you need some formal training in statistics. Statistical concepts can be complex and are not always intuitive. So, mastering the basics of statistics requires active practice using the concepts and procedures taught in the classroom. Indeed, one reason for creating this site it to use as a resource supplementing my own teaching.

This site may also be valuable to those who have been taught to use SPSS, but who want to learn to use R. Many of the computer examples will be demonstrated in both SPSS and R. 

# Software

I currently teach basic statistics courses in SPSS. While SPSS is relatively easy to learn for simple statistical procedures, it has some very real limitations. First, it is extremely expensive. While many university pay for licenses that make SPSS available to students and faculty, this program is not always available after students graduate. Second, SPSS is closed source. So if you want to know what is going on "under the hood", you are mostly out of luck. Third, SPSS is not very flexible. If you want to do anything that is not in the SPSS menu, and you haven't learned to use the very cryptic syntax of SPSS, you are again out of luck.

I prefer to do most of my own statistical work in R. I prefer R because it is extremely flexible and allows you to really understand exactly what you are doing. It is also free and open source. So you don't have to pay for R and you can dig into the code to see exactly what R is doing. The downside is that R is more difficult to learn.

So which should you use? I think that depends on what you plan to do with your statistical skills. If you plan on only conducting simple statistical procedures, SPSS might be all you need. But if you might need to do more complex analyses, R is worth the additional investment of time and energy. If you are a graduate student ask yourself this: Will I take only the statistics courses that are required for my graduate program, or am I interested in taking additional courses? If you plan on going beyond the basics, I think you should learn to use R.

But you don't have to make this decision as you start learning statistics. I suspect many people will start learning one of these programs and decide later to learn the other. There may also be some brave enough to try and learn both. I hope this website will be helpful in each of these cases. I will include code for both R and SPSS, and maybe for other programs (Stata next on my list). I also encourage others to provide code for software they may use.
