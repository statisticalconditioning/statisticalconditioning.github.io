# About Statistical Conditioning 

Learning statistics is a lot like getting into shape. Just as you can't get fit  by listening to a personal trainer talk about exercises, you can't master statistics by listening to lectures. 
While listening can be helpful, it is just the beginning. 
You have to apply what you learn to become proficient at using the statistical methods.
Like many things in life, you learn statistics by doing statistics.

But, there are different ways to do statistics.
Some ways can get you results quickly, but you might not really understand what you did.
Other ways may require more time and effort, but also promote a better understanding.
The least appealing aspect of statistics for most people is the math. 
Statistics is math, so there is really know way around that. 
You have to know the math to understand statistics.
But let's be clear on what we mean by math. 
Math is more than computational procedures. 
Fundamentally, math is formal reasoning, and it is this aspect of math that is most important to understand if you want to master statistics. 
We can get a computer to do the computational aspects of math for us, but, at least for now, computers will not replace good reasoning.
But, a good statistical programming language can allow us to pass off the tedious computations to the computer while still being very close to the reasoning needed to understand statistical methods


This site demonstrates quantitative methods commonly used in the social science, using statistical programming. 
There are two primary goals for developing these demonstrations.

  1. **Reasoning with Code** - A primary goal is to provide opportunities to help build intuitive understanding and practical skills upon the theoretical knowledge emphasized in most formal statistical training.
  2. **Statistical Programming** - Another goal is to provide opportunities to learn the R statistical  programming language, for those that know programs such as SPSS.
  
This site is aimed at supplementing -- but not replacing -- formal statistical training. Returning to the fitness analogy, you could walk into a gym and use the equipment with no understanding of the correct technique. At best this could be inefficient; at worst, it could lead to injury. Likewise, to best use this site you need some formal training in statistics. Statistical concepts can be complex and are not always intuitive. So, mastering the basics of statistics requires active practice using the concepts and procedures taught in the classroom. Indeed, one reason for creating this site it to use as a resource supplementing my own teaching.
