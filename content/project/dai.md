# Course Description

Basic methods of descriptive and inferential analysis including t-tests,
between and within subjects ANOVA, mixed ANOVAs, hierarchical designs and chi-square tests as they are utilized in educational research. Emphasis is placed on developing a solid foundation in statistical reasoning, including the assumptions, limitations, and common mistakes in using statistical methods.

# Course Objectives

Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to:

* explain the process of hypothesis testing and apply it to research problems
* identify different types of research designs and variables found in published articles
* describe the strengths and limitations of different research designs
* identify applications of a wide variety of statistical procedures
* solve educational research problems using statistical tests of significance
* make accurate interpretations of statistical findings
* use data analysis software (SPSS) to solve statistical problems
* review published research literature to examine the application of measurement, design, and analysis procedures
* prepare a written summary of data analysis results in APA format
