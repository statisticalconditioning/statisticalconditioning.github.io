      <title>Modeling, Model Comparison,  and the General Linear Model</title>

      <description>In this post I present a brief overview of a model comparison approach to the general linear model. The goal is to establish a framework to understand basic statistical methods including \(t\) tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression. This framework and the example data are from Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelly (2018). Follow this link to find information on this textbook and the accompanying website. Both are excellent, but the text is somewhat advanced for those just learning statistical methods.</description>

      <title>One Way ANOVA </title>

      <description>When comparing a continuous outcome between two groups, the \(t\) test is the basic test used. But, what do you do when you have more than two groups to compare? A foundational technique for this purpose is analysis of variance (ANOVA). This post is a conceptual overveiw of ANOVA, leading to example analyses aimed at developing intuitions about how ANOVA works. To get the most out of this post, you should work through a textbook chapter on one way ANOVA ahead of time.</description>

      <description>Cohen’s D Cohen’s D is the number of standard deviations an effect is shifted above or below the populations mean stated by the null hypothesis.
z test When we have known population parameters, we use them to calculate \[ d = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma} \] Note that \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation and NOT the standard error of the mean.
 One-sample t test \[ d = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s} \]</description>

      <description>Important Notation Scientific notation, while often confusing and frustrating initially, is very useful in helping to convey complex ideas in a compact and precise manner. The table below contains scientific notations relevant to the previous tutorial on central tendency and this one on variability.
We will be using the following notation in this class:
  Symbol meaning    \(y\) Dependent Variable  \(x\) Independent Variable  \(N\) Population size  \(n\) Sample size  \(\Sigma\) Sum of  \(\mu\) Population mean  \(M\) sample mean (also often \(\bar{x}\))  \(M_w\) Weighted mean (or \(\bar{x}_w\) )  \(IQR\) Interquartile range  \(\sigma^2\) Population variance  \(s^2\) sample variance  \(\sigma\) Population standard deviation  \(s\) sample standard deviation     Range GRE scores for two classes with the same mean (151.</description>

      <description>The first step in analyzing data is often getting the data into your chosen software. In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to manually enter data into SPSS and R as well as how to import existing date from two common formats.
Manually Entering Data Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you had the following data on five students grades you wanted to enter into SPSS and R. You have 5 cases, in this example students, and two variables, the student&amp;rsquo;s name and their grade.</description>

      <description>This is the third tutorial in a series that demonstrates how to us full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation using the R package lavaan. In this post, I demonstrate two methods of using auxiliary variable in a regression model with FIML. I am using data and examples from Craig Ender’s website Applied Missing Data. The purpose of these posts is to make the examples on Craig’s website, which uses Mplus, available to those who prefer to use lavaan</description>
