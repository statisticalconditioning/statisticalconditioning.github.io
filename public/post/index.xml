      <description>This is the third tutorial in a series that demonstrates how to us full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation using the R package lavaan. In this post, I demonstrate two methods of using auxiliary variable in a regression model with FIML. I am using data and examples from Craig Ender’s website Applied Missing Data. The purpose of these posts is to make the examples on Craig’s website, which uses Mplus, available to those who prefer to use lavaan.</description>

      <description>When I have to prepare data for Mplus, I use the MplusAutomation package in R. Its great! I import the SPSS data file into R with the foreign package. Then I use the prepareMplusData() function to create a .dat file for use in Mplus. This function also creates basic Mplus code that can pasted into Mplus or a text file used to prepare Mplus code files. MplusAutomation has many other great features and I highly recommend it for those who use Mplus and R.</description>

      <description>This tutorial demonstrates how to use full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation to deal with missing data in a regression model using lavaan.
 Import Data   In this post I use FIML to deal with missing data in a multiple regression framework. First, I import the data from a text file named ‘employee.dat’. You can download a zip file of the data from Applied Missing Data website. I also have a github page for these examples here.</description>

      <title>FIML in Lavaan: Descriptive Statistics</title>

      <description>FIML for Missing Data in Lavaan Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) is a modern statistical technique for handling missing data. If you are not familiar with FIML, I would recommend the book entitled Applied Missing Data Analysis by Craig Enders. The book is both thorough and accessible, and a good place to start for those not familiar with the ins and outs of modern missing data techniques.
The purpose of the FIML in Lavaan series of posts and the related git repository is to take some of the examples related to FIML estimation within a regression framework from the Applied Missing Data website, and translate them into code for the R package lavaan.</description>

      <title>Getting Data Into SPSS and R</title>

      <description>The first step in analyzing data is often getting the data into your chosen software. In this tutorial, I demonstrate how to manually enter data into SPSS and R as well as how to import existing date from two common formats.
Manually Entering Data Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you had the following data on five students grades you wanted to enter into SPSS and R. You have 5 cases, in this example students, and two variables, the student&amp;rsquo;s name and their grade.</description>
