      <description>In this post I present a brief overview of a model comparison approach to the general linear model. The goal is to establish a framework to understand basic statistical methods including \(t\) tests, analysis of variance, and linear regression. This framework and the example data are from Maxwell, Delaney, and Kelly (2018). Follow this link to find information on this textbook and the accompanying website. Both are excellent, but the text is somewhat advanced for those just learning statistical methods.</description>
