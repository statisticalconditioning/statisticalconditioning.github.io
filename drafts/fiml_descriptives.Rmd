# FIML for Missing Data in Lavaan

Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) is a modern statistical technique for handling missing data. If you are not familiar with FIML, I would recommend the book entitled [Applied Missing Data Analysis][2] by Craig Enders. The book is both thorough and accessible, and a good place to start for those not familiar with the ins and outs of modern missing data techniques.

The purpose of the **FIML in Lavaan** series of posts and the related [git repository][4] is to take some of the examples related to FIML estimation within a regression framework from the Applied Missing Data [website][1], and translate them into code for the R package `lavaan`. The code on the Applied Missing Data website in mostly for Mplus, which is quite expensive software. I hope this will give those who donâ€™t have access to Mplus the ability to work through the examples using free and open source software. 

In this first tutorial I start with the basics: how to get descriptive statistics using FIML. The data and Mplus code for this example can be found on the [Book Examples][3] page of the Applied Missing Data website. I also created a github repository with the data and R files with equivalent code in `lavaan`, which can be found [here][4]. Remember to replace the file path in the R code below with the file path to the folder in which you unzip the data files.

You will also want to read over the `lavaan` documentation and visit the very helpful `lavaan` [website][5] to take advantage of the tutorials there. With these resources at your disposal, you should be able to use replicate the examples in `lavaan`. Here, I walk through the major sections of the R code. This is the same code found in the github repository in the R file entitled *FIMLdescriptivesCorrelations.R*.

## Header

I always include a header with basic information in my code files.

```
## Import and prepare data

First, import the data into R. MPlus uses *.dat* files which can only contain numbers. Variable names are not included in the *.dat* file, but instead are included in the Mplus *.inp* file. I use the *read.table* function to read the *.dat* file.
```    
    employee <- read.table("data/employee.dat")
```

Next, I assign names to the variables in the new data frame.

```
    # Assign names to variables.
    names(employee) <- c("id", "age", "tenure", "female", "wbeing", 
                         "jobsat", "jobperf", "turnover", "iq")
```
The final step in preparing the data is to recode the data values -99, which are used as missing data values in the *.dat* file, to `NA`, which is the missing value indicator in R.
```
    # Replace all missing values (-99) with R missing value character 'NA'.
    employee[employee==-99] <- NA
```
## Create Model Object
Now that the data are ready, I create a character string with the model using the `lavaan` syntax. For descriptives and correlations I model the mean, variances, and covariance/correlations. 
```    
    # Create descriptive model object
    model <- '
    # means
    age      ~ 1
    tenure   ~ 1
    female   ~ 1
    wbeing   ~ 1
    jobsat   ~ 1
    jobperf  ~ 1
    turnover ~ 1
    iq       ~ 1
    
    # variances
    age      ~~ age
    tenure   ~~ tenure
    female   ~~ female
    wbeing   ~~ wbeing
    jobsat   ~~ jobsat
    jobperf  ~~ jobperf
    turnover ~~ turnover
    iq       ~~ iq
    
    # covariances/correlations
    age      ~~ tenure + female + wbeing + jobsat + jobperf + turnover + iq
    tenure   ~~ female + wbeing + jobsat + jobperf + turnover + iq
    female   ~~ wbeing + jobsat + jobperf + turnover + iq
    wbeing   ~~ jobsat + jobperf + turnover + iq
    jobsat   ~~ jobperf + turnover + iq
    jobperf  ~~ turnover + iq
    turnover ~~ iq
    '
```
## Fit the Model

To fit the model, I use the `lavaan` *fit* function. This function takes the first two argument model and data. The third argument is `missing ='fiml'`, which tells lavaan to use FIML (the default is to use listwise deletion).  
```    
    fit <- sem(model, employee, missing='fiml')
```
Alternatively, you could leave the section of the model code under the `# means` section and use the `meanstructure=TRUE` argument in the fit function as follows, which give the same results:
```
    fit <- sem(model, employee, missing='fiml', meanstructure=TRUE)
```
## Generate Output

To print the results to the console, use the `summary` function. 

```
    summary(fit, fit.measures=TRUE, standardize=TRUE)
```
The `fit.measures=TRUE` calls fit statistics in the output. This should look familiar to those who have used Mplus.

Recall that correlations are standardized covariances, so correlations are found in the *std.all* column in the *Covariances* section. Also, intercepts are means, and can be interpreted as the FIML means for the variables.

Finally, to get the missing data patterns and covariance coverage output that can be included in Mplus output use the following code:
```
    # Get missing data patterns and covariance coverage similar
    # to that found in Mplus output.
    inspect(fit, 'patterns') 
    inspect(fit, 'coverage')
```    

which leads to the following output:
